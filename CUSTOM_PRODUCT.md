# Ultra Starter
### Price: 40
The idea behind Ultra Starters is to enable people to start the season playing decks that are a combination of bad and hard to get that makes them not worth playing by the time you could actually pull them from only random packs. They aren't all necessarily "bad" decks, but they all fill the role of providing a start for decks that cannot organically grow out of fixed product currently in the game. For example, "Ultra Starter Wyrm Party" provides a very basic Tenyi package and a basic synchro deck that is aimed at people wanting to build Tenyi Swordsoul. Each Ultra starter is roughly balanced against the Legendary Hero Decks Aesir Deck and provides 6 additional packs to customize your deck. This product is intended to require your entire starting budget to encourage their use solely as a way to start the season. Not to be confused with Super Starters.
